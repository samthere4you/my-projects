The responses are the possible replies or answers that the chatbot can provide for a specific intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the main components of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading Intents: The load_intents function reads the JSON file and extracts the list of intents. It retrieves the 'intents' key from the loaded JSON object and returns the intents as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matching User Input: The get_intent function takes the loaded intents, user input, and context as inputs. It iterates through the intents and their patterns to find a match for the user input. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding intent. If no match is found, it returns None. It also updates the context if the intent has a 'context_set' attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating Responses: The get_response function takes an intent as input. If the intent exists, it retrieves the associated responses and randomly selects one response to return. If the intent is None, it returns a fallback response indicating that the chatbot doesn't understand the user's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversation Loop: The project includes a conversation loop that allows the chatbot to interact with the user. It starts by printing a greeting message. Inside the loop, it takes user input, checks for a matching intent using get_intent, and retrieves a response using get_response. If no intent match is found or the intent requires a context switch, a fallback response is used. The loop continues until the user decides to exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project demonstrates a basic implementation of a chatbot using intents and responses stored in a JSON file. It showcases how the chatbot can understand user queries, match them with predefined intents, and provide appropriate responses. This approach allows for easy customization and expansion of the chatbot's capabilities by modifying the JSON file to include new intents, patterns, and responses."
